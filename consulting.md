- Four major topics: Value, Thinking, Communication, Management
- Value
    1. Professionalism
        - Principle: Ask why, client first, honest, down-to-earth
    2. Fact-based
        - What: Test our intuiition hypothesis based on actual fact (data)
        - Why: Improve credibility
        - How: Goal Oriented, fact based
            - Collect data -> Analyze based on Fact, and use MECE principle to breakdown problem (decouple, indepedent) 
            -> Come up solution based on assumption -> Test whether the assumption holds
    3. High-level Perspective
        - From a high level perspective, make the solution objective and natural.

- Thinking
    1. 0-based thinking
        - Normal problem: Use framework to come up with a feasible solution.
        - Special problem: Break down the framework and use creative thinking to get a feasible solution.
        - Always keeps client's value in mind.
        
    2. Logical thinking
        - Pyramid principle
            - Conclusion is the answer to the topic(issue)
            - Depth View:
                - Top down (break down the problem, Explanation): Why so?
                - Bottom up (Summarize): So What?
            - Width View:
                - MECE: Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive
                - Parallel architecture
                    - problem -> conclusion -> evidence 1, evidence 2, evidence 3
                    - MECE: No repeats, omission, digression
                - Explanation architecture
                    - problem -> conclusion -> fact, reasoning, conclusion
                    - MECE: Causal relationship between each component
                    
    3. Issue thinking (Issue Tree?)
        - Observe a phenomenon, think about the root cause, not to focus on the superficial thing.
        - Convert the problem to a solvable and meaningful problem.
        - What is a good issue?
            - High impact, core problem
            - Profound hypothesis, new insight
            - High probability to find a solution
            
    4. Hypothesis thinking
        - Problem -> hypothesis(what could be the reason) -> solution
        - Come up with a potential solution first rather than collect all the evidence before making a conclusion.
            - This helps to improve the efficiency.
            - Collect more related evidence.

- Communication
    - Before communication
        - Think from client perspective: Focus on what problem you guys want to solve and what you can offer? Not on what you want to say.
        - What you want to get after the conversation: understanding, feeling, suggestion, decision or action?
    - During conversation
        - Pyramid principle: Conclusion first and then explanation.
        - SCQA framework: Situation, complication, question, answer
    - **DONOT use words that cause confusion**
        - Be subjective: I think, my opinion -> Based on research (fact), 
        - Don't do XX -> Based on XX reason, it is better to.

- Management
    - Leadership Mentality:
        - What will I do if I'm the leader? 
    - Set a clear and effective goal
        - what is a bad goal?
            - No logic
            - Too ideal
            - No benefit
            - Not flexible
        - Be quantitative as much as you can.
