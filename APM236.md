## Simplex Method
- Relationship to duality

## Two-phase method
- if (A) has optimal value < 0, we conclude that (P) is infeasible.
- if (A) has optimal value = 0, we construct a feasible basis for (P) and solve it in the second phase

- in Phase 1, we solve an auxiliary LP problem to either
get a feasible basis or conclude that (P) is infeasible
    - (P) has a feasible solution ⇐⇒ (A) has optimal value 0.
    - In general, the auxiliary problem is never unbounded; Its optimal value is ≤ 0.
- in Phase 2, we solve (P) starting from the feasible
basis found in Phase 1.

- Feasible: domain, x possible


- Standard form (<=) and canonical form (=)

## Several questions to think about
- 只考虑了标准多面体， 不等式条件的约束？无边界？
- 不止两条直线相交于极点
- 可行解为空，最优解不存在
- 更好的规则进行换基？
- 如何保证每次迭代都会更好

- Basic solution and basic feasible solution
