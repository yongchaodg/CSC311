# Chapter 1: Measure Theory and Integration
- Probability Space
    - Probability triplets: (Ω,F,P)
        - Ω: Outcomes
        - F: Events. (σ-field, σ-algebra)
        - P: A function that assign probability to events
        
    - Example: Discrete probability space
        - Ω: A countable set, i.e. finite or countably infinite
        - F: The set of all subsets of Ω.
        - P: P(A)= SUM(P(ω))
        - Τhis is the most general probability measure on this space.
            
    - Measurable Space: (Ω,F) Space where we can put a measure.
        - Def: Measure μ: Non-negative _countably additive_ **set function**
            1. μ(A) >= μ(0)=0, for all A in F.
            2. Measure of Union of Countable sequence of disjoint sets = Sum of the measure of each set.
            - Note: If μ(Ω) = 1, we call μ a probability measure (always denoted by P).
        - Properties: Measure μ
            1. Monotonicity: Larger sets have larger measure. (proof by difference and non-negativity of measure)
            2. Subadditivity: Measure of union <= Sum of the measure of individual set. (proof by splitting to disjoint set)
            3. Continuity from below: If a sequence of sets converges up to a set A, then the measure will also converges to μ(A). (proof by constructing disjoint sets, countably many -> Def2 -> limit representation)
            4. Continuity from above: If a sequence of sets (A1 has a finite measure) converges down to a set A, then the measure will also converges to μ(A). (A1-An converges to A1-A, apply 3; μ(A1-B) = μ(A1) -μ(B) if B in A1)
        - Example: Measure on the real line
            - Measures on (R,R) are defined by giving probability a Stieltjes measure function F
                - F is nondecreasing
                - F is right continuous (approach from above is cts), i.e. limy->x F(y) = F(x)
            - Associated with each Stieltjes measure function F, there is a unique measure μ on (R,R) with μ((a,b]) = F(b)-F(a) (Appendix a.1)
                - Closed on the right: b_n -> b, Intersection((a,b_n]) = (a,b]
                - Open on the left
            - Example: F(x) = x, the resulting measure is called Lebesgue measure.
            
    - Why we need measure?
        - What kind of events are we interested in? The collections of events that form a σ-field. 
            - Def: σ-field.
                1. closed under complement 
                2. closed under countable union 
                3. closed under countable intersection
            - Properties of σ-field
                - The intersection of σ-field is still σ-field (true even for uncountably case). (Proof)
                - σ-field generated by A: Given Ω, and a collection A of subsets of Ω, there exists a smallest σ-field containing A.
            - Development of σ-field
                1. Semialgebra: 
                    1. closed under complement 
                    2. complement is a finite disjoint union of sets
                2. algebra(field)
                    1. closed under complement 
                    2. closed under pairwise union (Todo: Is this equivalent to countably union), so also closed under intersection
                3. σ-field

                - From Semialgebra -> Algebra: Finite disjoint union of sets from semialgebra.
                
            - Development of measure on σ-field. 
                - How to compute the measure for different kinds of sets.
                - The extension theorem
                    1. For semialgebra, the measure of finite union of disjoint sets = finite sum of the measure of the sets
                    2. For semialgebra, the measure of countable union of disjoint sets <= countable sum of the measure of the sets
                
            - Example: Borel Sets
                - Smallest σ-field containing all the open sets.
    
- Distribution
    - A random variable X induces a probability measure on R called its distribution by setting μ(A) = P(X in A) for Borel sets A.
    - The distribution of a random variable X is usually described by giving its distribution function, F(x) = P(X<=x)
    
- Random Variables
    - Random variables defined on a sigma-field with probability measure P.
    - Random variable is just a measurable map from sigma-field to Borel sets.

# Chapter 2: Laws of Large Number
- Independence: It is much easier to understand independence from conditional probability
    - Definition of Independence: Probability of Union = Product of individual probability
        - Independence of sigma-field
        - Independence of Random Variables: Inverse Image of Borel Sets(sigma-field) are independent.
        - Independence of Events: Create R.V's using indicator function.
    - Check Independence: Check independence of sigma-field
        - pi-system: closed under pairwise intersection
        - lamda-system: 1. omega 2. difference 3. "continuous" from below
        - Theorem: if pi-systems are independent then sigma field generated by them are independent
        - pi-lamda theorem: if lamda system contains a pi system, then it contains a sigma field generated by the pi-system.
